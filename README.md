### What I learned

How to import env variables in Vite. In order to do it, you have to use something like this:

```js
const url = import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL
```

Always use use meta object, because inside it are store env variables.

### Useful resources
[Env Variables and Modes](https://vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode.html) - This helped me for use and declare env variables using Vite. This information is important if you're using it, because it always depend how the bundler or tool has predefine acces to env variables.
